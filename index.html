          <h3 class="purple-header">Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
          <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful in the Engineering Flex program, based out of Salem, Massachusetts (go Witches!)</p>
          <p>I'm passionate about learning to create websites and apps that are as visually appealing as they are functional.</p>

          <h3 class="purple-header">About Me</h3>
          <p>Before becoming a student at Thinkful, I have had the opportunity to work in many customer-facing roles, from Business Development Representative and Store Associate, to Service Experience Manager.</p>
          <p>However, I knew this path wasn't for me.</p>
          <p>This has lead me to begin the journey to becoming a Software Developer, allowing me to use the perspective I have gained in those roles, towards shaping the customer experience from the code-up!</p>
